# titanic-survival-prediction
End-to-end machine learning project predicting passenger survival on the Titanic.End-to-end machine learning project predicting passenger survival on the Titanic.

## Dataset
Kaggle Titanic dataset containing passenger details like age, gender, class, and fare.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 84%
- Random Forest Accuracy: 80%
- Gradient Boosting: 80%
- Decision Tree: 78%

## Key Insights
- Female passengers had higher survival rates
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive
- Age and fare influenced survival probability

## How to Run
